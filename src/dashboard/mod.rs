//! Optional server-side-rendered admin dashboard for the pooler.
//!
//! Runs in-process (a `tokio::spawn` in `main`) so it can read the pooler's
//! live in-memory session counts (`SchemaRegistry::snapshot`) alongside the
//! daemon's VM inventory (`Sandbox::list`). Enabled only when
//! `PG_VM_POOL_DASHBOARD_LISTEN` is set; gated behind HTTP Basic auth when
//! `PG_VM_POOL_DASHBOARD_USER`/`PASSWORD` are configured.
//!
//! The main "Databases" view (`/`) is a paged, searchable, state-filtered
//! list of every heyvmd sandbox — power state, allocated size (vCPU/RAM),
//! uptime, and live pooler sessions. The daemon's list endpoints have no
//! server-side paging, so the filter/page slice happens in-process and only
//! the visible page is joined and rendered. On the detail page it also shows
//! live DB size/backends read over the pooler's own warm PG pool. It drives
//! stop/start/reboot/resize on any VM, and tails the pooler / heyvmd / per-VM
//! Postgres logs.
//!
//! A `/monitoring` view adds whole-host health — total CPU % and memory % from
//! heyvmd's `/system/usage` sampler, plus per-filesystem disk saturation read
//! directly on the host with `df` (the pooler shares the host with heyvmd) — and
//! pooler-fleet aggregates rolled up from the same inventory. It also configures
//! webhook alerts on those host metrics: a background evaluator (see `alerts`)
//! samples them on an interval and POSTs a webhook when a rule crosses its
//! threshold.
//!
//! Guest-console access (SDK `commands()` exec) goes through the VM's PID-1
//! serial-console shell on this image and can halt the VM, so the browsable
//! pages (index + detail) perform **no** guest access — only daemon reads and
//! safe PG-pool queries. The one guest exec, the per-VM Postgres log tail, is
//! confined to its own explicitly-navigated `/logs/vm/{id}` page. Every daemon
//! and guest call is timeout-bounded so one wedged VM can't hang a request.
