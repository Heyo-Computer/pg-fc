/// there is no matching mount and the daemon answers `Mount not found:
/// /workspace (available mounts: [])`.
///
/// # Why success is decided in S3, not in the guest
///
/// On these VMs `exec` is not a reliable channel. The daemon drives a **single
/// shared shell on the guest's serial console**, writing a marker-delimited
/// command and reading until the end marker, under a fixed 30s timeout
/// (`execute_via_serial` in mvm-ctrl's Firecracker driver). While `pg_dump` and
/// `curl` saturate the one-vCPU guest and its single virtio disk, even `[ -f x ]`
/// can miss that window — so a probe times out and the daemon answers `500
/// Command timed out after 30 seconds`.
///
/// That failure is about the *channel*, not the job: the detached dump neither
/// uses nor cares about the serial console. Treating it as a dump failure — as
/// this did — aborted archives that were running fine, precisely when the VM was

///

/// the VM and reclaims its disk on our `Ok`, destroying the only other copy.
/// The guest sentinel is kept as a best-effort fast path: it turns a failed dump
