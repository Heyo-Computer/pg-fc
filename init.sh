# disk toward its cap, and only an offline fstrim/reap gets it back. Put temp
# files on a RAM tmpfs instead (linked in below, once PGDATA exists): they never

# --- online filesystem growth (thin provisioning) ----------------------------
# The filesystem starts small (see the mkfs above) and must be grown before the
# database fills it. ext4 grows *online* — resize2fs on the mounted device from
# inside the guest, no VM restart, sub-second — so this watcher polls free space
# and doubles the filesystem (capped at the device size) whenever headroom drops
# below 1GB or 1/8 of the filesystem, whichever is larger. That headroom covers
# several seconds of worst-case bulk-load writes between 5s polls; if a burst
# outruns it anyway the damage is one query's disk-full error, and the next poll
# still grows the filesystem (WAL keeps 512MB+ of budget, so the PANIC path
# stays guarded). After each step the disk-derived Postgres knobs are recomputed
# and reloaded (both are SIGHUP-safe). Exits once the filesystem spans the
# device — immediately on legacy disks formatted before thin provisioning.

# Run Postgres as a background child rather than `exec`-ing it as PID 1. The
# heyvm daemon drives an exec channel over the serial console (ttyS0): it writes
# `echo START; (cmd); echo END $?` to the console and waits for a *shell* to run
# it. It uses this for lifecycle ops like /etc/hosts injection. If Postgres owns
# the console (exec postgres), nothing services that channel, so every daemon
# exec blocks ~30s then fails over to SSH (also absent) — adding tens of seconds
# to each VM create, and worse as sibling VMs multiply. Keeping a shell on the
# console (below) makes creates fast.
#
# Trade-off: Postgres no longer receives the VM's SIGTERM directly. That's fine
# here — Postgres is crash-safe (WAL replay on next boot) and the data dir is
# currently ephemeral. If clean shutdown matters later, trap TERM in this shell
# and forward it to $PG_PID.
# OOM-killer insurance (matters if the strict-overcommit setup above was
# skipped or still trips): shield the postmaster at -900 so the killer never
# takes out the whole cluster. The score must be lowered *before* dropping
# root (unprivileged processes can only raise it), and children inherit it —
# PG_OOM_ADJUST_FILE is Postgres' built-in reset: the postmaster writes 0 into
# each backend's oom_score_adj at fork, so a runaway backend dies before the
# postmaster (a backend kill is a recoverable restart; losing PID-postmaster
# means our pooler-side power-cycle).
