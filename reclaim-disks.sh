# reclaim-disks.sh — return stranded free space from idle VM data disks.
#
# Each per-schema VM has a sparse `data.ext4` (provisioned at
# PG_VM_POOL_DATA_DISK_GB, mostly holes). When Postgres frees blocks inside the
# guest — recycled WAL, vacuumed heap, dropped temp/tables, a reinitialised
# cluster — ext4 marks them free, but with no TRIM/discard reaching the host the
# blocks are never punched out of the backing file. So a disk ratchets toward its
# full provisioned size and never shrinks, even though the live database is tiny
# (we've seen 1.1 GB of data pinning 51 GB on disk).
#
# This offline-reclaims every data disk whose VM is NOT currently running:
# recover the journal left dirty by an unclean VM kill (`e2fsck -fp`), then
# punch every free block and unused inode-table block out of the backing file
# with `e2fsck -fp -E discard`. Both operate on the image file directly — no
# loop device, no mount, no fstrim. (An earlier version went
# loop-mount+fstrim; that path silently stopped punching holes on at least one
# production host — fstrim errors were swallowed and runs "reclaimed" ~0B from
# hundreds of GB of slack — while file-level discard keeps working, since it's
# a plain fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE) on the file.)
#
# SAFETY: a disk a live Firecracker still has open is skipped — writing to a
# filesystem a running guest has mounted would corrupt it. Everything else is
# best-effort per disk: one failure never aborts the run.
#
# SHRINK=1 additionally *shrinks the filesystem* toward its used size before
# trimming. Legacy disks were formatted across the whole device, so even after
# an fstrim their next growth ratchets straight back toward the full
# provisioned size, and the ~1GB of full-device ext4 metadata stays allocated
# forever. Shrinking retro-fits the thin-provisioning cap the image now applies
# at first format (see init.sh): target = used * 1.25, floored at MIN_FS_MB
# (default 4096, matching init.sh's initial size); the guest's grow watcher
# re-extends the filesystem online if the database needs more. Blocks past the
# new filesystem end are hole-punched out of the backing file directly (fstrim
# can't reach past the fs). The shrunk fs is re-fscked before anything mounts
# it; a disk that fails that check is reported and left unmounted.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./reclaim-disks.sh [RUN_DIR]        # default RUN_DIR: ~/.heyo/run
#   sudo DRY_RUN=1 ./reclaim-disks.sh [DIR]  # report candidates, change nothing
#   sudo SHRINK=1 ./reclaim-disks.sh [DIR]   # also shrink filesystems (slower)
#   sudo PRUNE_SWAP=1 ./reclaim-disks.sh [DIR]  # also delete guest swapfiles
#
# PRUNE_SWAP=1 deletes each stopped VM's /swapfile (via debugfs, no mount;
# the journal-recovery fsck that follows frees the unlinked blocks and the
# discard pass punches them). Swap contents are dead the moment a VM stops
# (swap never survives a boot), and init.sh recreates the file — sized to the
# filesystem — on the next boot, so this is pure reclaim: the swapfile is
# fully allocated (fallocate/dd, not sparse), up to 2GB per VM on large-RAM
# fleets, and a plain free-block discard can never touch it because it's a
# live file.

# Point-in-time set of every file held open by any process, keyed by
# device:inode. A live Firecracker keeps its data disk open as a plain fd under
# /proc/<pid>/fd — but Firecracker usually runs under *jailer*, which chroots the
# VM, so the fd's path is relative to that chroot and will NOT equal the host
# path. Matching by path therefore silently misses running VMs and trims them
# (corrupting a disk the guest has mounted RW). device:inode is the same file
# object regardless of chroot, bind mount, or mount namespace, so it is the
# safe identity to compare.
#
# Built once (a single `find | stat` over all fds) rather than re-scanning /proc
